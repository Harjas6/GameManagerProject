# My Personal Project

## Game Manager

### What will this application do?
This application will be able to log the games a user has inputs and track the
hours spent on each game through *manual* updates as well as store details about the
games difficulty, genre, price, personal ranking, and whether it is owned or not.
It can also tell you what games you are able to buy according to the users budget.
It can also derive average values for the price/difficulty/hours played of each game.

### Who will use it?
Anybody who wishes to manage or view all the games they have played/wanted and
also wish to compare them or see basic stats.
### Why is this project of interest to you?
This is of interest to me as I always have wanted to see/compare how many hours
I have spent on game as in game timers either do not exists or can be innacurate for games
sometimes. I also wanted a way to track/manage games I have or want to get
so this app will help me with that, especially track money spent. 
### **User Stories**
