# My Personal Project

## Game Tracker

### What will this application do?
This application wil be able to log the games a user has played 
and the time spent per game through *manual* entry as well as make a wishlist of
game the user wishes to play in the future ranked by importance. 
It can also provide statistics on hours spent per game.

### Who will use it?
Anybody who wishes to see a statistical view of the amount of time 
they spend on a game(s) and would like to see it visualized.
### Why is this project of interest to you?
This is of interest to me because I have wanted to log the amount of hours
I have spent on a game or multiple games and see how it compared
to other things in my life.

### **User Stories**
- As a user, I would like to add a new game, to a list of
current games or pending/wishlist games.
- As a user, I would like to be able to games sorted in some simple fashion (alphabetical, hours played, etc).
- As a user, I would like to be able to increment
the hours spent on a game multiple times (ex. be able to add to a running total).
- As a user, I would like to create multiple lists of game (ex.per genre).
- As a user, I would like to see a graph/table showing the
hours played on my games in a chosen list.
